The goal is to guess the "code" - a particular combination of four colors (repeats possible). After each guess feedback is given by black and white pegs to the right of the guess. A black peg means the corresponding color in the guess appears in the code at the same place. A white peg means the color is in the code, but not in that slot. No peg means the color is not in the code. If you have the same color multiple times in your guess, and it appears in the code fewer times, then feedback is only given for the number of that color in the code. The feedback pegs are ordered:<br>
1 2 <br>
3 4
