Mancala is a family of games that originated in Africa. The Mancala game this applet simulates is the variant called Kalah, which is the most well known in the Western world. Kalah strongly favors the first player to move. <BR>
<BR>
Moving<BR>
Players take turns selecting one of the six pits on their side of the mancala, removing the seeds from the pit, and "sowing" them in a counter-clockwise direction, one seed per pit. The pits at the ends are called the kalahas. The right kalaha is player one's, the left, player two's. Players sow seeds in their own kalaha, but not their opponent's.<BR>
<BR>
Extra Move<BR>
If the last seed a player sows lands in his or her kalaha, the player may move again. There is no limit to the number of extra moves that can be gained.<BR>
<BR>
Capturing<BR>
If the last seed a player sows lands in an empty pit on his or her side, and there are seeds in the opponent's corresponding pit, then the last seed and the contents of the opponent's pit are all moved to the player's kalaha.<BR>
<BR>
Winning<BR>
The game is over when one player has no seeds on his or her side. The player with seeds remaining moves all seeds to his or her kalaha. The winner is the player with the most seeds in his or her kalaha.<BR>
